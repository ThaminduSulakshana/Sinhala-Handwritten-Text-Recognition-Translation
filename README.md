# Sinhala-Handwritten-Text-Recognition-Translation

Sinhala Handwritten Text Recognition and Translation  This repository contains the code and resources for an AI/ML project aimed at recognizing Sinhala handwritten text and translating it into English. The project integrates image pre-processing, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and machine translation techniques to create a comprehensive pipeline.  ## Features: - **Image Pre-processing:** Converts images to grayscale, applies Gaussian blur, and performs binary thresholding to enhance text recognition. - **OCR:** Utilizes Tesseract OCR configured for Sinhala script to recognize and extract characters from handwritten text images. - **Translation:** Uses Google Translate API to translate recognized Sinhala text into English. - **Batch Processing:** Processes multiple images and handles errors with meaningful messages.
